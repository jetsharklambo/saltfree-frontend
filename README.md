# 🧂 SaltFree - Get Paid Without The Drama

> *Because winners deserve their money without the salt*

🚀 **NOW LIVE ON BASE MAINNET** with USDC & Custom Token Support!

## 🚀 What Is This Glorious Thing?

SaltFree is a Web3 platform to pay and win online or IRL games free of salty interactions. Instead of trusting your drunk friends to pay up after losing at poker, FIFA, or beer pong, you all put crypto into a smart contract first. Support for ETH, USDC, and custom tokens means everyone can play with their preferred currency. When the game's over, winners get paid automatically. No salt, no "I'll Venmo you later," just cold hard crypto.

### 🔥 Features That Actually Matter

- **🪙 Multi-Token Support** - ETH, USDC, and any custom ERC-20 token
