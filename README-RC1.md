## 📖 API Documentation

### Game Management
```typescript
// Create new game
const gameData = await addFoundGame(gameCode, userAddress);

// Join existing game  
await recordGameJoin(gameCode, buyInAmount);

// Update game result
await updateGameResult(gameCode, 'won', winningsAmount);
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
import { validation } from './utils/envUtils';

// Validate game code
const sanitizedCode = validation.sanitizeGameCode(userInput);

// Validate wallet address
const sanitizedAddress = validation.sanitizeAddress(address);
```

### Logging
```typescript
import { logger, logGameAction } from './utils/logger';

// Production-safe logging
logger.info('Game created', { gameCode, buyIn });

// User action tracking
logGameAction('game_joined', gameCode, { userAddress });
```
